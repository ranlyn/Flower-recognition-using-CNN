# Flower-recognition-using-CNN
## This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify flower species from images. Trained on a large dataset, the CNN model accurately classifies flowers, handling variations in perspective and lighting.Incorporated with a user-friendly interface using Tkinter.Here user can enter the path of the image and can find about the species of the flower.
